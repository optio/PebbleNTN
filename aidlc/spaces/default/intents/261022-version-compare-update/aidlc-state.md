# AI-DLC State Tracking

## Project Information
- **Project**: Detect a phone app update without an internet check by comparing versions: the watchapp auto-updates but the phone (companion) app needs a manual update, so when the watchapp version is higher than the connected phone app version, treat it as update available (watch side: reuse the #94 notice, idle text and launcher subtitle; phone side: show the Update available card when the watch reports a higher version). Compare versions numerically part by part (0.0.9 < 0.0.10), ignore unparsable versions. If the phone app install source is detected as F-Droid, show a warning that the update may take about a day before F-Droid makes it available. The update card links to the install source and says "Update from {source}" instead of "Update now", and lets the user pick another source.

# Implementation Status

_Last updated: 2026-07-12_

## Current milestone

**M1 — Domain model and protocol** (`spec/800-roadmap/Milestones.md`) — **complete**.

> Implement generated protocol constants, normalized navigation model, session reducer and fake
> watch transport.

- **M0 — Repository and builds:** complete and verified (Android + watch builds green locally).
- **M1 — Domain model and protocol:** complete and verified.
  - `protocol/` single-source definition + Python generator → read-only `Protocol.kt` and
    `protocol.h` (with `--check` gate wired into CI and `test-all.sh`).
  - `core/`: `Maneuver`, `NavigationInstruction`, `NavigationState`, `WatchSettings`,
    `DistanceQuantizer`, and the pure `NavigationSessionReducer` (events/effects/state).
  - `protocol/`: `AppMessage`, `ProtocolCodec` (encode/decode), `WatchTransport` interface +
    `FakeWatchTransport` test double.
  - 48 JVM unit tests, 0 failures; `test lint assembleDebug` green.

Next: **M2 — Notification access and early filtering**.

## Requirements in scope for M0

M0 is scaffolding; it establishes the ground for these requirements without yet implementing
their behavior:

- REQ-ANDROID-001 (platform: Kotlin, Compose M3, minSdk 31, release-verified target SDK) —
  Gradle configuration in place; CI (`android.yml`) exercises it. Compile not yet verified locally.
- Build/CI/release structure from `spec/600-security-release/BuildRelease.md`.
- Monorepo layout from `spec/200-architecture/System.md`.

## What exists after M0

```
android/                Gradle project (wrapper 8.11.1), :app module
  gradle/libs.versions.toml   version catalog (see rationale below)
  app/                  empty Compose M3 app (MainActivity placeholder, Application, theme)
watchapp/               Pebble C watchapp (builds to build/watchapp.pbw)
protocol/               placeholder (M1 generates protocol constants)
rules/                  catalog/ bundled/ fixtures/ test-cases/ (M4/M6)
tools/rule-workbench/   placeholder (M8)
scripts/                bootstrap, build-all, test-all, build-watchapp,
                        run-android-emulator, install-android-debug,
                        validate-rules(.sh + .py), validate-spec-assets.sh

## Dependency version selections (newest stable compatible with the Android baseline)

Policy: CLAUDE.md — pick the newest stable version compatible with the declared baseline
(minSdk 31, compileSdk 36), record it in the version catalog, and note the rationale here.

| Component | Version | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Gradle wrapper | 8.11.1 | Minimum Gradle required by AGP 8.9.x; current stable line. |
| Android Gradle Plugin | 8.9.1 | First AGP line that supports `compileSdk = 36` (Android 16). |
| Kotlin | 2.1.0 | Current stable; bundles the Compose compiler plugin (`kotlin.plugin.compose`). |
| KSP | 2.1.0-1.0.29 | Must track the Kotlin version; used by Room. |
| Compose BOM | 2024.12.01 | Latest stable BOM aligning Compose UI/Material3 artifacts. |
| Room | 2.6.1 | Current stable; KSP-compatible. |
| kotlinx.serialization | 1.7.3 | Current stable JSON. |
| kotlinx.coroutines | 1.9.0 | Current stable. |
| JDK | 21 | Per `spec/600-security-release/BuildRelease.md` (LTS baseline). |

If a newer stable set is available at build time and remains baseline-compatible, bump the
catalog and update this table.

## Commands executed this session

```bash
# Android build — PASSED (assembleDebug + test + lint) after installing local JDK 21 + SDK 36
source ~/.local/pebblentn-env.sh && ./android/gradlew -p android assembleDebug test lint

# Watchapp build — PASSED (5 platforms: aplite, basalt, chalk, diorite, emery -> watchapp.pbw)
cd watchapp && pebble build

# Spec asset integrity — PASSED (34 files match MANIFEST.sha256.json)
./scripts/validate-spec-assets.sh

# Ruleset schema validation — PASSED (examples/example-ruleset.json)
./scripts/validate-rules.sh

# YAML + bash syntax checks — PASSED (all workflows, all scripts)
```

## Local toolchain

Resolved the earlier "no JVM/Android toolchain" blocker by installing a local toolchain (network
was available):

- Temurin **JDK 21.0.11** at `~/.local/jdk-21.0.11+10`.
- Android SDK at `~/.local/android-sdk` — `platforms;android-36`, `build-tools;36.0.0`,
  `platform-tools`; licenses accepted.
- Env helper: `source ~/.local/pebblentn-env.sh` sets `JAVA_HOME`/`ANDROID_HOME`/`PATH`.
- `android/local.properties` (git-ignored) points Gradle at the SDK.

**M0 Android build is now verified locally:** `./gradlew assembleDebug test lint` → BUILD
SUCCESSFUL. (Fixed one real defect found this way: `BuildConfig.DEBUG` required
`buildFeatures.buildConfig = true` under AGP 8.)

## Blockers

1. **Pebble SDK build in CI is best-effort** — `watchapp.yml` installs `pebble-tool` and the SDK
   at run time. The local build passes with SDK v4.9.169; pin a maintained SDK image if the
   public distribution changes.
2. **No emulator / connected device** — instrumented tests
   (`connectedDebugAndroidTest`) and manual UI runs cannot execute here; JVM unit tests, lint,
   and APK/AAB assembly all run locally.

## Next atomic task

Begin **M2 — Notification access and early filtering** (REQ-ANDROID-002/003/004/005,
REQ-SEC-003/004):

1. Bundled navigation-app catalog (`rules/catalog/`) + loader: app id, packages, display name,
   capture-only vs official-rules flags, default-enabled policy.
2. `EnabledAppRepository` (Room) — default-enable installed catalog apps; user can disable.
3. `NavigationNotificationListenerService` performing the **package allowlist check before reading
   any notification content** (REQ-ANDROID-003), dispatching to a serialized processing queue.
4. `NotificationSnapshotFactory` producing the minimal documented snapshot (REQ-SEC-003) — only
   after allowlisting.
5. Onboarding + notification-access disclosure screen (REQ-SEC-004) before sending to system
   settings.
6. Instrumented spy test proving the snapshot factory / parser / DB are never touched for a
   disabled package. (Instrumented tests need a device/emulator — not available locally; gate in
   CI or mark as a known local limitation.)

## Notes / decisions

- Kept everything in `:app` for M1 (pure `core`/`protocol` packages have no Android imports, so a
  future `:core-model` extraction is mechanical). Revisit module split when compile coupling
  warrants it (likely around M4 rule engine).
- Authoritative protocol input lives at `protocol/protocol-definition.json` (not the
  integrity-protected `examples/` copy); `check_consistency.py` prevents drift and lets us define
  flag bits + maneuver codes the example asset does not carry.

- Modules kept minimal (`:app` only) per System.md guidance ("do not prematurely create dozens
  of modules"); `core-model` / `rule-engine` / `pebble-transport` extraction deferred until the
  boundaries reduce compile coupling (likely M1/M4).
- `fixture-publisher`, `protocol`, `tools/rule-workbench`, and `rules/*` carry placeholder READMEs
  so the committed layout matches `spec/200-architecture/System.md`; they are wired in their
  owning milestones.
- Watchapp `main.c` deliberately defines **no** protocol key/event constants — those come from the
  generated header in M1.
